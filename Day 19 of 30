 What is a Cumulative Sum?
 
A cumulative sum, also known as a running total, tracks the progressive addition of a sequence of numbers. It helps you visualize how a value accumulates over time (or any other ordered series).
 
Calculating Cumulative Sum in SQL:
 
There are two main approaches to calculate the cumulative sum in SQL:
 
1. Window Function (Modern Approach):
 - Utilize window functions like `SUM` with the `OVER` clause.
 - This method is generally more efficient and readable for complex queries.
 
2. Self-Join (Traditional Approach):
 - Create a self-join on the table itself.
 - This method can be less efficient for large datasets.
 
Example (Window Function):
 
Suppose you have a table `Sales` with columns `Date` and `DailySales`. Here's how to find the cumulative sales for each date:

SELECT Date, DailySales,
 SUM(DailySales) OVER (ORDER BY Date) AS CumulativeSales
FROM Sales;

Explanation:
 
 The `SUM` function with `OVER` calculates the running total of `DailySales` ordered by `Date`.
 `CumulativeSales` is the alias for the calculated sum.
 
Remember: 
Choose the approach that best suits your specific scenario and database capabilities.
Window functions are generally preferred for performance and readability.
