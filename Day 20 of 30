What SQL operators are used for pattern matching?

The LIKE operator is used to search for a specific pattern within a column. It is used with a WHERE clause to query specific columns.

LIKE is used with two wildcard characters:

% - represents a 0, 1 or multiple characters.

_ (underscore) - represents a single character

Here are a few examples:

WHERE Employee Name LIKE '%r' - Finds matches that end with "r"

WHERE Employee NAME LIKE '%gh%' - Finds matches that include "gh" in any position `

WHERE Employee NAME LIKE '_ch%' - Finds matches with "ch" in the second and third positions
 
WHERE Employee NAME LIKE 'g%r' - Finds matches that start with "g" and end with "r".
